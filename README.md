Uh,
summa
lumma
dooma
lumma
you
assuming
I'm
a
human
What
I
gotta
do
to
get
it
through
to
you?
I'm
superhuman
Innovative
and
I'm
made
of
rubber,
so
that
anything
you
say
is
Ricocheting
off
of
me
and
it'll
glue
to
you
I'm
devastating
more
than
ever
demonstrating
How
to
give
a
motherfuckin'
audience
a
feeling
like
it's
levitating
Never
fading,
and
I
know
that
haters
are
forever
waiting
For
the
day
that
they
can
say
I
fell
off,
they'll
be
celebrating
'Cause
I
know
the
way
to
get
'em
motivated
I
make
elevating
music
You
make
elevator
music
```
